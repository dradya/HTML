    <p>This project delves into the tragic incident of NASA's Columbia Space Shuttle, which disintegrated upon reentering Earth's atmosphere on February 1, 2003, ending the lives of all seven astronauts onboard, including India's Kalpana Chawla. The crew was returning from a two-week mission, and everything appeared normal until communication was suddenly lost. The world watched in shock as the shuttle disintegrated, marking a dark day in space history. It has been 21 years since this disaster,as of 2024, with no similar incidents in space missions since. Join us as we pay tribute to Kalpana Chawla and explore the details of this fateful mission.

    <h1>Mission Facts</h1>
    <ul>
    <p><i><strong> Two STS missions:-</strong></i></p>
    <li><p>STS-87 and STS-107 were both Space Shuttle missions, with STS-87 launching in 1997 and STS-107 launching in 2003:</p></li>
    <h4><u>STS-87</u></h4>
    <p>Launched on November 19, 1997, this mission focused on materials science and microgravity research. The mission's primary payload was the U.S. Microgravity Payload-4 (USMP-4). The crew included Kalpana Chawla, who operated the robotic arm to deploy the Spartan Satellite.</p>
    <h4><u>STS-107</u></h4>
    <p>Launched on January 16, 2003, this mission was a 17-day science mission that featured microgravity experiments. The mission ended in disaster when the Columbia orbiter disintegrated during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on February 1, 2003, killing all seven crew members, including Kalpana Chawla.</p>
    <li><p>This was the <u>28th flight</u> of the space mission Colombia Program - STS-107</p></li>
    <li><p>Colombia was the first space shuttle to fly in space; its first flight took place in April 1981, and it successfully completed 27 missions before the disaster.<br>STS program was designed specifically for reusability.</p></li>
    <li><p>Chawla flew on two Space Shuttle Missions as a mission specialist. On NOVEMBER 19,1997, she launched on board space shuttle Colombia as a part of STS-87. Chawla specialized in operation the robotic arm, which she used to deploy the Spartan Satellite.</p>
    <p><b>about the Spartan Satellite : A satellite that would be sent to study the outer layer of the Sun.</b></p></li>
    <li><p>During the 16 day mission, the crew conducted numerous experiments, with a focus on materials science<br>Like, it was observed how plant reproduction works in microgravity.</p></li>
    <li><p>Columbia's 28th Space mission, designated STS-107, which was originally scheduled to launch on January 11,2001 and was delayed 13 times.On 16 Jan 2003, at 10:29AM, leaves the Earth for the last time.<br>It was launched from Kennedy Space Center</p></li>

    <h1>THE MISSION</h1>
    <p>The mission of these astronauts was to conduct non-stop experiments for 24 hours working in shifts. For 16 days, when they were in space, they carried out around 80 experiments in life science, material science and fluid physics.<br>With Chawla overseeing and conduction microgravity experiments on crystal growth, combustion and fire suppression, as well as prostate cancer</p>
    <p>The data was constantly being transmitted to Earth.Approximately 30% of the data from these experiments was saved, collected and kept in the ground stations.</p>

    <h1>What was the reason behind this incident?</h1>
    <p>Did the pilot make a mistake?<br>Or did some crew member make some hasty decisions?<br>Was it the fault of an astronaut?</p>
    <p>None of the 7 astronauts in Columbia made any mistake.<br>Even 3-4 minuts before the accident, none of them of them had any idea about what was going to happen.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>08:58 AM<br>Columbia's backup flight software showed some message on the display -<br><strong>Four wheels on left side of the spacce shuttle has LOST PRESSURE</strong></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>altho the astronauts had no idea about this, some people in NASA knew about this problem 16 days before the accident.</p>
    <p>After 81 seconds of Columbia's launch, a small piece of foam separated from the shuttle and collided with the left wing.<br>this foam was used to connect Columbia's external tank to the main shuttle.<br>60cm long, 40cm wide.750g, 700-900 km/hr</p>
    <p>Two or three days after the space shuttle Columbia's liftoff, a group of NASA engineers asked the shuttle program manager to request the aid of United States spy satellites in determining the extent of debris damage to the shuttle's left wing, but the manager declined to do so, a senior NASA official said.<br><small><small>~By Edward Wong, March 13, 2003</small></small><br>this is why when this was later found out after the incident, in April 2003, STS Program Manager RON D. DITTEMORE resigned from his position acknowledging his mistake.</p>
    <p>Several people within NASA pushed to get the breached wing in orbit.<br>The Deparment of Defence was reportedly prepared to use its orbital spy cameras to get a closer look.<br>However, NASA officials in charge declined the offer, according to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) and "CommCheck", a book by space journalist Michael Cabbage and William Harwood.<br><small><small>~By Elizabeth Howell, Daisy Dobrijevic, last updated January 25, 2023</small></small></p>
    <p>In August 2003, the CIAB released a thorough report explaining why this Columbia Disaster happened and what caused it.<br>This report mentioned NASA's negligence again.<br>NASA's human space flight chief WILLIAM READDY's failure to accept the U.S. Defence Department's offer to obtain spy satellite imagery of the damaged shuttle.</p>
    <p>The mission went on as planned for the next 15 days, until 1st February 2003, when the mission was over and the space shuttle had to return to Earth.</p>
    <p>The damage on the left wing of the space shuttle caused a small hole.<br>As it descended into Earth's atmosphere, the damage bacame even bigger and as soon as it happened, a piece of insulation asa big as a suitcase broke.</p>
    <p>A significant portion of Columbia was now exposed to external fire and gases.<br>Due to this, the sensors in the left wing stopped working first. Temperature readings weren't available. Then the tire pressure readings disappered.<br>And just like that, the spacecraft started to break apart into pieces.</p>
    <p>The report in CAIB in 2003 stated that such foam strikes happen regularly during space shuttle launches.<br>Such foam strikes were very common. But the problematic part about this foam strike was that this piece hit the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
    <p>5 years after the incident, Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report was published in December 2008. This report tried to reconstruct the crew's last minuts.<br>Warning signs and alerts were ringing all around. There were problems with tire pressure and landing gear.<br>It also stated that even if the crew's personal safety equipment had been better designed they could not have survived the breakup of the shuttle on February 2003.<br><small><small>~James Randerson, science correspondent, Wed 31 Dec 2008</small></small></p>
    <p>after this incident, NASA stopped this space shuttle program for 2.5 years. Also, the design of the foam ramp was changed</p>
    <p>The space shuttle program was continued until the International Space Station was functional in July 2011. Until then, 135 missions were carried out under this program and it had completed 30 years.<br>In these 30 years, 14 Astronauts lost their lives in unfortunate accidents.</p>
